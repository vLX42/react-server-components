# React Server Component

Simpel demo with React Server Components, this only a POC for getting it to run on vercel/next.js, this is only used for a lightning talk at the DFDS Frontend Community

Have a look at the example from the React team for a better and more extensive demo.

There a two project in this folder, a client component version and a server components version. It's only to compare speed an bundle sizes.
